          When we collect and use your personal data for new purposes, we will
          inform you before or at the time of collection (and ask for your
          consent when required) unless we reasonably consider that this purpose
          is compatible with the original one as detailed above.
        </p>

        <h4>Legal basis</h4>

        <p class="mb-0">
          We consider that the legal bases for using your personal data as set
          out in this Personal data protection policy are as follows:
        </p>

        <ol class="bold-number">
          <li>
            <strong>Contractual necessity:</strong> our use of your personal
            data is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with
            you or to take steps prior to entering a contract with you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compliance with legal obligations:</strong> our use of your
            personal data is necessary for complying with our legal obligations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> our use of your personal data
            is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate
            interests of others. Our legitimate interests might include the
            following:
            <ol class="alpha">
              <li>running, growing and developing our business;</li>
              <li>
                operating and ensuring the security of our websites and apps;
              </li>
              <li>
                ensuring a safe working environment for our staff and visitors;
              </li>
              <li>
                consumer knowledge, market research and business development;
              </li>
              <li>providing services to our customers;</li>
              <li>
                investing in and rolling out new products to benefit the
                communities in which we operate;
              </li>
              <li>for internal group administrative purposes; and</li>
              <li>
                to create profiles and provide you with personalized messages
                and tips about products directly, as well as through traditional
                and social media campaigns based on your interests and
                preferences. More information on how your personal data is used
                and how to opt out is explained below in the “Profiling and
                automated decision making” section of this Personal data
                protection policy.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Whenever we collect and use your personal data on the legal basis
              of legitimate interests, we take care it does not outweigh your
              rights as an individual.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your personal data on the
            basis of your consent. Where you have given consent, but you later
            change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by contacting us and
            we will stop doing processing your personal data in this way.
            However, if you withdraw your consent, this may impact our ability
            to provide our products and associated services to you.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>4. Profiling and automated decision making</h2>
        <p>
          We may analyze information about you in order to create profiles (e.g.
          by compiling individuals into groups that we believe to have certain
          common characteristics). We use these profiles to personalize our
          websites, apps, services or products, as well as our communications to
          you (e.g. by sending/displaying content that may be relevant and
          useful to you, subject to applicable data protection and e-privacy
          laws). We may also use these insights to display relevant advertising
          to you either on our websites or apps, or via third-party websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some services and products, we may process your personal data
          using automated means. Essentially this means that decisions are taken
          automatically without human intervention. We will not make decisions
          based solely on automated decision making to the extent that they have
          a legal effect or significant impact on you without first notifying
          you and providing you with clear information about any such automated
          decision-making, including our lawful basis for carrying it out and
          the ability to have a human intervention for reviewing the decision.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Links to other websites</h2>
        <p>
          Our websites and apps may contain hyperlinks to third party websites,
          plug-ins or applications that are not operated by us. These hyperlinks
          are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply
          any endorsement of the activities of such third-party websites or any
          association with their operators.
          <br />
          This Personal data protection policy only applies to the personal data
          that we collect or which we receive from third party sources and over
          which we act as a data controller, and we cannot be held responsible
          for personal data about you that is collected and stored by third
          parties. Third party websites have their own terms and conditions and
          privacy policies, and you should read these carefully before you
          submit any personal data to these websites.
          <br />
          We do not endorse or otherwise accept any responsibility or liability
          for the content of such third-party websites or third-party terms and
          conditions or policies.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Social Media and other User Generated Content</h2>
        <p>
          Some of our websites and apps allow users to submit their own content.
          Please remember that any content submitted on our product/brand
          page(s) on social media platforms can be viewed by the public and
          reposted, and you should be cautious about providing certain personal
          data e.g. financial information or address details. We are not
          responsible for any actions taken by other individuals if you post
          personal data on one of our product/brand page(s) on social media
          platforms. We reserve the right to delete user generated content that
          doesn’t comply with the relevant terms & conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children’s Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          Most of our websites are designed and intended for use by people of
          legal age. We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to
          protect the privacy and safety of children.
        </p>
        <p>We do not request or knowingly collect personal data from minors.</p>
        <p>
          If we discover that we have collected personal data from a child
          without consent from a parent or legal guardian, we will delete that
          personal data as soon as we become aware of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only exception concerns the collection of personal data of minor
          children carried out directly from a parent or guardian, with their
          consent (for example, when a parent has answered questions about the
          age of their children in a form published on one of our websites).
          <br />
          In such a case, by using the Website, the user acknowledges and
          guarantees that he/she is the legal representative of the child whose
          data he/she is providing.
          <br />
          Also, we do not contact or knowingly collect personal data directly
          from minor children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other Danone Group companies may contact you if you have given your
          consent to receive communications about Danone Group brands. In this
          case, our brands can personalize the communications sent to you based
          on the information you provided to us in our forms (e.g.: first name
          or date of birth of your child). For more information, you can consult
          paragraph 8 – Sharing of personal data with third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can at any time check, modify or delete the personal data that you
          have transmitted to us about your child. You can also request the
          deletion of data relating to your child by proceeding as indicated in
          paragraph 12 – Your rights.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties</h2>
        <p>
          When we share your personal data with affiliates and other
          organizations, we make sure we only do so with organizations that
          safeguard and protect your personal data and comply with applicable
          privacy laws in the same or similar way that we do.
        </p>
        <p>Your personal data will never be sold or rented.</p>
        <p>
          We may, however, share or disclose your personal data as described in
          this Personal data protection policy. Your personal data will be
          shared with the following third parties for the purposes described:

            <strong>Other Danone companies/entities:</strong> Where it is in our
            legitimate interests to do so for internal administrative purposes

            operations, compliance, auditing and monitoring, research and
            development and quality assurance).

          <li>
            <strong>Third party service providers and subcontractors:</strong>

            social plug-ins from these businesses (such as the “Like” and
            “Share” buttons). These other businesses may receive and use
            personal data about your visit to our sites or apps. If you browse
            our website or view content on our apps, personal data they collect
            may be connected to your account on their site. For more information
            on how these businesses use personal data, please read their privacy
            policies.

            <strong>Business transfer recipients:</strong> Where we sell or buy
            any business or assets, (such as a merger/absorption), to the

            substantially all of our or any of our affiliates’ assets are
            acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us
            will be one of the transferred assets. Where appropriate, in such
            case, the buyer acting as the new data controller processes your
            data and its Personal data protection policy governs the processing
            of your personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal disclosure recipients:</strong> Where we are obliged
            by law to disclose your personal data (e.g. to government or law

            rights or those of our staff, customers or other third parties.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Save as expressly detailed above, we will never share, sell or rent
          any of your personal data to any third party without notifying you
          and, where necessary, obtaining your consent.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Sharing Personal Data Internationally</h2>
        <p>
          Your data will not be shared other than as described in this Personal
          data protection policy. Your personal data may be used, stored and/or
          accessed by staff working for us, other members of our group, trusted
          third parties or when required by law and/or government authorities
          operating outside your country of residence.
          <br />
          When we share your data internationally, we make sure only to do so
          with entities that safeguard and protect your data and make sure that
          the cross-border data processing complies with applicable data
          protection laws and is protected by adequate safeguards.
        </p>

        <h2>10. How We Protect Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          We understand that the security of your personal data is important. We
          make our best efforts to protect your personal data from misuse,
          interference, loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.
          We have implemented a number of security measures to help protect your
          personal data, and we require that trusted third parties who handle
          your personal data for us do the same. For example, we implement
          access controls, use firewalls and secure servers, and we encrypt
          personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the course of provision of your personal data to us, your personal
          data may be transferred over the internet. Although we make every
          effort to protect the personal data which you provide to us, the
          transmission of information over the internet is not completely
          secure. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee
          the security of your personal data transmitted to our website and that
          any such transmission is at your own risk. Then, once we have received
          your personal data, we will use strict procedures and security
          features to prevent unauthorized access to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which
          enables you to access your online account, you are responsible for
          keeping this password confidential.
        </p>

        <h2>11. How long we store your personal data</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your personal data for no longer than necessary for the
          purposes for which the personal data is processed. The length of time
          for which we retain personal data depends on the purposes for which we
          collect and use it, for the duration of your contractual relation with
          us and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and regulations
          as well as to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, where you make a purchase online with us or register for
          a webinar, we will keep the personal data related to your purchase or
          registration, so we can perform the specific contract you have
          entered. After that, we will keep the personal data for a period which
          enables us to handle or respond to any complaints, queries or concerns
          relating to the purchase or registration.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Where we process your personal data, you are entitled to a number of
          rights established in the relevant applicable laws and can exercise
          these rights at any point. We have provided an overview of these
          rights below together with what this entails for you. You can exercise
          your rights by contacting us here: dpo.dnao@danone.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will consider all such requests and, in accordance with the
          applicable laws, will provide our response within a reasonable period,
          or within the period prescribed by law. Please note, however, that we
          may rely on certain exemptions to complying with your requests in
          certain circumstances, for example if we need to keep using the
          information to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish,
          exercise or defend legal claims. If an exemption applies, we will tell
          you this when responding to your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm
          your identity before responding to any request you make.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The right to be informed</strong>
          <br />
          You have the right to obtain clear, transparent and easily
          understandable information about how we use your personal data, and
          your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in
          this Personal data protection policy.
          <br />
          The right to access your personal data and correction
          <br />
          You have the right to access the personal data we hold about you, as
          well as correct, update or complete it at any time.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The right to deletion of your personal data</strong>
          <br />
          You have right to request that we delete your personal data. However,
          this is not an absolute right and we may have legitimate, legal and
          regulatory reasons to retain your personal data.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The right to object</strong>
          <br />
          Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object to certain
          types of processing based on grounds relating to your particular
          situation when such processing is based on our or another’s legitimate
          interest. If you exercise this right, we will stop using your personal
          data for this purpose, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
          grounds to continue processing your personal data that would outweigh
          your interests, rights and freedoms. You have the right to object to
          the processing of your personal data for direct marketing activities
          (for example, by clicking on the unsubscribe link in our emails).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The right to withdraw consent</strong>
          <br />
          Where we rely on your consent to process personal data, you have the
          right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting our
          processing of your personal data before you withdrew consent.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-0">
          <strong>The right to restriction of processing</strong>
          <br />
          Under certain circumstances you have the right to restrict the
          processing of your personal data if:
