        <h2>WHO WE ARE?</h2>
        <p>
          Danone Nutricia Côte d’Ivoire SA operates this website in your
          territory. When we say “Danone”, “us”, “our” or “we”, this is who we
          are referring to.
          <br />
          At Danone, we want to be open and transparent in the way we use
          cookies so you can make an informed choice on the information you
          share with us. This cookie statement explains how we and certain third
          parties use cookies and similar technologies on the website, and how
          to manage your choices on the information you share with us.
          <br />
          If you have any further questions or comments, feel free to contact us
          via
          <a href="mailto:bledimaconseil@danone.com">

        <h2>
          WHAT ARE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES WE USE ON THIS
          WEBSITE?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Like many companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies to
          ensure you get the best from this website. In this document, when we
          refer to “cookies”, we are referring to cookies and other tracking
          technologies, as described below.
        </p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          “Cookies” are small text files from a website that are stored on your
          computer, mobile phone, or other device. Cookies generally contain
          information that is associated with your web browser, information such
          as website preferences, login information, or a user identification.
        </p>

        <h3>Other tracking technologies</h3>
        <p>
          Like other online services and mobile applications, we use both
          cookies and other technologies such as web beacons/GIFs, pixels tags,
          embedded scripts, and other tracking technologies. These technologies
          consist of small transparent image files or other web programming code
          that record how you interact with the website. They are often used in
          conjunction with web browser cookies or other identifiers associated
          with your device. Below is a more detailed description of some of the
          other types of tracking technologies we may use on this website:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pixels tags are small images or small snippets of code inserted into
            web pages, advertisements, or emails. Pixels tags collect
            information such as your browser or device and can also set cookies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Local storage allows data to be stored locally on your browser or
            device and includes HTML5 local storage and browser cache.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Statistical modelling</h3>
        <p>
          When you browse and interact with our websites, we also collect
          aggregated and non-identifying information such as device type, time
          of the day, country, browser type, page URL and conversion type, which
          is a metric that identifies an action a user has taken on a website
          (i.e., making a purchase, registering for an event, or subscribing to
          a newsletter)
          <br />
          We use these anonymized data to build statistical models, allowing us
          to infer the impact of our ads on users’ actions, such as purchases,
          while respecting your privacy. This helps us refine our advertisements
          to make them more relevant to our consumers, thereby enhancing their
          experience on our websites.
          <br />
          It is important to underscore that this method of gathering
          information does not, under any circumstances, enable users’
          identification.
        </p>

        <h4>WHY DO WE USE COOKIES?</h4>
        <p>
          Generally speaking, there are a few reasons why we, and certain third
          parties, may use cookies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            cookies that are necessary for the website to function and to enable
            you to make use of the services we provide;
          </li>
          <li>
            cookies that collect data related to the use of our website and the
            performance of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            cookies that we use to personalize and optimize your experience on
            our website. These cookies store information on your choices such as
            text size, language and screen resolution; and
          </li>
          <li>
            cookies that are placed for enhanced services, for scientific and
            consumer knowledge purposes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please see below for further information on the types of cookies we
          use on this website.
        </p>

        <h4>SESSION COOKIES AND PERSISTENT COOKIES</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Session cookies:</strong> these are created temporarily in
            your browser’s subfolder while you are visiting a website and are
            automatically deleted when you leave the website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Persistent cookies:</strong> in contrast to session cookies,
            persistent cookies are re-activated when you return to the same
            website and remain in your browser’s subfolder until they expire
            (the duration of cookies is indicated in the tables specific to each
            type of cookies in the tables below)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>TYPES OF COOKIES USED ON THIS WEBSITE</h3>
        <h4>Necessary cookies</h4>
        <p>
          These cookies are needed in order for the website to function
          properly.
          <br />
          For example, we may use necessary cookies for logging in, filling in
          forms or to enable other features and functions of the website. We
          also use necessary cookies to maintain the security and stability of
          our services. Because these cookies are necessary to the security and
          functionality of our services, they cannot be switched off via our
          cookie consent tool.
          <br />
          If these cookies are blocked, it may affect your usage of our website.
          <br />

        <h4>Analytics and performance-related cookies</h4>
        <p>
          These cookies help us to understand visitor’s habits so that we can
          improve our online products and services. For example by determining
          which areas of our website have been visited and how long, to get
          insights about users behavior, or identify technical issues
          encountered. This information allows us to ensure our website is
          functioning properly and is providing the best experience for our
          users. We may also use analytics cookies as part of our data
          management platform to track results of our marketing campaigns or
          understand if your visit was driven by the use or purchase of a
          product or service from us

        <h2>YOUR PREFERENCES</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your preferences as per above retention periods, but it is
          still possible to restrict or block certain cookies or even delete
          certain cookies that have already been placed on your device. If you
          do so, we may think that you have never visited us before and will
          therefore show you the Cookie Statement again and ask for your consent
          in placing cookies.
          <br />
